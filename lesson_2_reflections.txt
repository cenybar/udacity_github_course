# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to 
do it?

A .git file gets created. You need to do this in order to keep track of 
your changes with git.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It lets you put files there and try things before comitting a change. 
It offers the testing value, among others.

 # How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
 logical change?

Not sure on this one, maybe adding only one file at a time?

# What are some situations when branches 
would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?

Branches might be useful when, for example, trying different versions of
the code (other language, easier version, experimental version, etc)
Branches would help to keep track of the different versions organized.

# How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams are like a map, to track back the branch components.
