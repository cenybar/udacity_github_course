# When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

To have a back-up other than my local location, to collaborate with 
other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Same reasons we discussed earlier regarding manual or automatic saving.
Maybe you don't want some changes to be pulled right away, maybe you
don't want to have that many files automatically created and there,
etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are only available when using Github. They are used to copy other
coders work. Clones can be done as a way to save locally things forked
from Github or other sources. Branches are modifications done to an
original document (the master for example). They are useful for trying
new features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

It's an updated back up.
